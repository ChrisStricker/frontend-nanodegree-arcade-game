Player Instructions
===================

Move the player from the grass to the water while avoiding the lady bugs.  As the player moves up the screen, he gains points.  The more points he gains, the faster the ladybugs will move.

The player moves with the arrow keys: up, down, left, right.

For each new row that the player achieves in a round, he gains 10 points.
If the player reaches the water, he gains 100 points.
For each ladybug he collides with, the player loses 100 points and is knocked back a row.

The game level increases for every 500 points that the player scores.  Increasing the game level will increase the speed of the ladybugs.
